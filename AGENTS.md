## Task Completion Requirements

- `vp check` and `vp run typecheck` must pass before considering tasks completed.
  - If changing native mobile code, `vp run lint:mobile` must also pass.
- Use `vp test` for the built-in Vite+ test command and `vp run test` when you specifically need the `test` package script.

## Merging Upstream

This is a fork of `upstream` (pingdotgg/t3code). **Before merging `upstream/main` into
`main` — and while resolving any merge conflicts — read `FORK_NOTES.md` first.** It tracks
the fork-specific divergences (and the exact files touched) that are most likely to conflict.
After the merge, update `FORK_NOTES.md` if the divergences changed.

We have over 200,000 users who love T3 Code. It's important we maintain the things they love as we continue to iterate on the product. Here's a brief list of the things we can never compromise on.

## Project Snapshot

T3 Code is a minimal web GUI for using coding agents like Codex and Claude.

This repository is a VERY EARLY WIP. Proposing sweeping changes that improve long-term maintainability is encouraged.

## Core Priorities

1. Performance first.
2. Reliability first.
3. Keep behavior predictable under load and during failures (session restarts, reconnects, partial streams).

If a tradeoff is required, choose correctness and robustness over short-term convenience.

## Maintainability

Long term maintainability is a core priority. If you add new functionality, first check if there is shared logic that can be extracted to a separate module. Duplicate logic across multiple files is a code smell and should be avoided. Don't be afraid to change existing code. Don't take shortcuts by just adding local logic to solve a problem.

## Package Roles

- `apps/server`: Node.js WebSocket server. Wraps Codex app-server (JSON-RPC over stdio), serves the React web app, and manages provider sessions.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and client applications. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@t3tools/shared/git`) — no barrel index.
- `packages/client-runtime`: Shared runtime package for sharing client code across web and mobile.

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.

## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under `.repos/` as read-only reference material for coding
agents.

- Prefer examples and patterns from the vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under `.repos/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from `.repos/`; application code must continue importing from normal package dependencies.
- Manage vendored subtrees with `vpr sync:repos`; use `vpr sync:repos --repo <id>` to sync one configured repository.
- When updating a dependency with a configured vendored subtree, sync that subtree in the same change so
  `.repos/` matches the installed dependency version.
- When writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` first and inspect `.repos/effect-smol/` for
  examples of idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
- When writing relay infrastructure code with Alchemy, inspect `.repos/alchemy-effect/` for examples of
  idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.

Of note: Most T3 Code contributions will come from T3 Code itself, often controlled remotely. This means you should be careful about accessing data, killing dev servers, and other things that may damage the T3 Code instance that the contributor is using.

## A small glossary

We need to be on the same page with terminology. When communicating, use this language:

- **you** means the agent reading this file and changing T3 Code.
- **we, us, and maintainers** mean Theo, Julius and the people building T3 Code. These are who you are talking to now.
- **user** means the person using T3 Code to direct coding agents.
- **agent** means the coding agent a user runs inside T3 Code. Depending on context, that may also include you.
- **provider** means the agent runtime or harness T3 Code talks to, such as Codex, Claude, Cursor, or OpenCode.
- **client** means the web, desktop, or mobile UI.
- **environment** means one running T3 server and the machine, filesystem, provider credentials, and state it owns.
- **project** means an environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.
- **thread** means the durable conversation and work history for a project.
- **turn** means one user-to-agent cycle, including follow-up work such as checkpointing.
- **T3 home** means the base data directory. Runtime state normally lives below its userdata directory.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or `kill` a PID you found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Your own agent process has this worktree's path in its argv, and this machine runs several other dev servers at once. Kill only a PID you captured at spawn, or the owner of your port from `ss -H -ltnp` after confirming `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is your worktree.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.t3/userdata` is the developer's real T3 Code database, in use while you work. Reading it and copying from it are fine, and a good way to get real test data (see Test data). Never start a server against it, never open it read-write, never clean it up.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for dev. Dev is single-origin and Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`. Setting them bakes localhost into the bundle and silently breaks every remote browser.

## Hit every surface

The most common defect in this repo is a change that works on the path you tested and is missing everywhere else. Before calling frontend work done, walk this list and say which entries applied:

- **Entry points.** A behavior reachable from the chat view is usually also reachable from Settings, the command palette, and a keybinding. Fixing one is not fixing the feature.
- **Clients.** Web, desktop (wraps web, adds Electron shell/IPC), and mobile (React Native, separate navigation). Shared logic lives in `packages/client-runtime`
- **Providers.** Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode each have an adapter. Provider-shaped features need a decision per adapter, even if the decision is "not supported here".
- **Contracts.** Anything crossing the wire is typed in `packages/contracts`. Change the schema and the server, web, mobile, and desktop all follow.
- **Reverse states.** If you added a way in, add the way out and the way to see it. Snooze needs unsnooze. Close needs reopen. A one-way door is a bug.
- **Connection modes.** Local, remote/relay, and tunnel behave differently. Multi-device and multi-environment cases are real.
- **Docs.** `docs/` splits by audience. Behavior changes that a user would notice belong in `docs/user/` (shipped-product voice, no repo tooling or source paths); architecture and contributor changes in `docs/internals/`; runbooks in `docs/operations/`; new vocabulary in `docs/internals/glossary.md`.

## Dev servers

- `vp i` installs. Worktrees get this from the t3.json setup script; if module resolution looks broken, it probably did not run.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web. In a worktree, state defaults to that worktree's gitignored `.t3`, which deliberately outranks an ambient `T3CODE_HOME` so you cannot land on shared state by accident. An explicit `--home-dir` still wins.
- Ports derive from the worktree path and are stable across restarts, but read the real ones from the `[dev-runner]` line since occupied ports shift.
- Sharing over the tailnet is three steps: run `vp run dev --share` in the background, wait for the `pairingUrl:` line in its output, paste that full URL (token included) in your reply. Do not wire up `tailscale serve` by hand for this, and do not open the URL yourself.
- The web app requires pairing. Hand over the pairing URL, not the bare origin. A URL without its token is useless to whoever you gave it to. If the token got consumed, mint a fresh one with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair` — note it carries standard scopes, while the startup URL carries admin scopes (needed for Settings → Connections management).
- Stop what you started, by the PID you tracked. See rule 1.

## Test data

An empty database is a bad test. Seed your worktree's `.t3` with a copy of real data instead of pointing at live state:

- Copy from `~/.t3/userdata` (the developer's real data, the most realistic test set) or `~/.t3/dev`. Worktree state lives at `<worktree>/.t3/userdata`.
- Snapshot the database with `VACUUM INTO`, which is safe even while a server has the source open and yields one consistent file:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p .t3/userdata
  rm -f .t3/userdata/state.sqlite*  # VACUUM INTO refuses to overwrite
  bun -e "new (require('bun:sqlite').Database)(process.env.HOME + '/.t3/userdata/state.sqlite', { readonly: true }).run(\"VACUUM INTO '.t3/userdata/state.sqlite'\")"
  ```

  A plain `cp` is only safe when no server has the source open, and must bring the `-wal` and `-shm` siblings along. A live file copy is a corrupt copy.

- Bring `secrets` and `settings.json` only if the flow under test needs them.
- Copy in, never symlink. Data flows one way: into your sandbox, never back out.

## Verifying

- Smallest proof that the change works. `vp test run <files>` for the tests you touched, targeted lint and typecheck for the scope you changed.
- **Do not run repo-wide checks.** No `vp check`, no `vp run -r test`, no `vp run -r typecheck` unless I ask. CI owns the full suite.
- Backend behavior changes ship with focused tests for that behavior.
- The server is event-sourced and its async flows emit typed receipts. Wait on receipts and worker drains, never on sleeps or polling. A test that needs a timeout to pass is wrong.
- Upon request, user-visible frontend changes should get one integrated pass in a real client: `test-t3-app` for web, `test-t3-mobile` for mobile. The primary agent does this once after integrating. Subagents do not launch their own dev servers. Ask permission before doing computer use or spinning up browsers.

## Pull requests

- Never make a PR unless the developer explicitly asks you to do so.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(web): new threads no longer spike CPU`.
- Body: the problem in a sentence or two, then how you fixed it. End with the model and harness that did the work.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion or timing needs a short video.
- Upload PR evidence to GitHub. Never commit PR-only screenshots or assets such as `.github/pr-assets/`.
- One concern per PR. If the description says "also", split it.
- When babysitting: poll checks and comments newer than the last push, verify each bot finding against the source, fix real ones, dismiss false positives with a written reason. Stay quiet when nothing is new. Stop when the bots are green on the latest commit.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files. Keep temporary working material outside the worktree. `.plans/` is gitignored only as a safety net for legacy tooling.
- Track active maintainer work in the GitHub issue or project item that owns it. External proposals follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and belong in Ideas discussions.
- Put durable architecture, constraints, and decisions in `docs/internals/`. Update those docs when the product changes so agents find current facts instead of abandoned intentions.
- A merged PR is the implementation record. Close or update its tracking item when the work lands; do not preserve a second checklist in the repository.

## How it works

Clients send typed WebSocket requests. The server turns them into _commands_, a pure _decider_ turns commands into persisted _events_, and a _projector_ derives the read model the UI renders. Provider CLIs run as subprocesses; per-provider _adapters_ translate their native protocols into orchestration events. Side effects run in queue-backed _reactors_ that emit _receipts_ when milestones land. Each turn ends with a _checkpoint_, a hidden git ref, so the app can diff and restore.

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` - WebSocket, orchestration, providers, checkpointing. Effect-heavy: read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` before writing Effect code.
- `apps/web` - React/Vite UI. `apps/desktop` wraps it, `apps/mobile` is React Native, `apps/marketing` is the site.
- `packages/contracts` - Effect/Schema contracts plus small derived helpers. No heavy runtime logic.
- `packages/shared` - shared runtime utils, subpath exports, no barrel.
- `packages/client-runtime` - client code shared by web and mobile.
- `.repos/` - vendored read-only references. Prefer their patterns over invented ones. Never edit or import from them. Sync with `vpr sync:repos` when bumping the matching dependency.

## Taste

- Complexity belongs at the adapter boundary. Orchestration stays pure, UI stays dumb.
- Inferred types over annotations. `any` is the enemy.
- Comments describe how a thing is used, and move when the code moves. To be used mostly to describe functions, not to annotate every line of behavior.
- Our users drive agents all day and notice a dropped frame, a lying spinner, and a stale label. No continuously repainting animations; they peg the GPU on high-refresh displays.
- If a rule here fights the task in front of you, say so loudly and get a human sign-off before breaking it.

## Additional tips

- Don't verify with browsers or computer use unless the user explicitly agrees or requests it.
- Security is important, but should not be over-indexed on, especially for dev mode/maintainer-only features.
